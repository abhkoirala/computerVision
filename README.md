Objective

The main objective of our project was to achieve a better recognition system for ASL alphabets
using different classifier and feature extraction methods. After researching many papers and
journals we found out that SVM, CNN and MLP could give us a better result. Also SIFT and
Gabor features would give us better features for our dataset. So, our main objective was to find
the combination of best classifier and the best feature extraction techniques for the
classification of ASL alphabets. Thus, we tried to implement two of the papers with SVM,
MLP and CNN in order to find the best possible combination to overcome the problem of ASL
alphabet classification problem.
